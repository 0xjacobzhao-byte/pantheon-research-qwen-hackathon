# Judge Walkthrough

A 10-minute path through this repository for a human judge or an AI reviewer.
Everything here runs **offline with no secrets**; live mode is optional.

---

## 1. What to inspect first

| Priority | File | Why it matters |
|----------|------|----------------|
| 1 | [`backend/app/alibaba_cloud_proof.py`](../backend/app/alibaba_cloud_proof.py) | Alibaba Cloud deployment proof (v2). Honest host detection, precise RDS claim, no secrets. |
| 2 | [`backend/app/qwen_overlay.py`](../backend/app/qwen_overlay.py) | Qwen Cloud (DashScope) integration. Fail-closed: missing key → `BLOCKED_BY_MISSING_CREDENTIAL`, bad JSON → `PARSE_ERROR`. |
| 3 | [`backend/app/comparison.py`](../backend/app/comparison.py) | Dual-model comparison engine: `data_state` derivation, agreement scoring, divergence, human-review gate. |
| 4 | [`frontend/src/components/equity/OverlayComparisonPanel.tsx`](../frontend/src/components/equity/OverlayComparisonPanel.tsx) | Product-grade Qwen-vs-DeepSeek UI with fail-closed states. |
| 5 | [`backend/app/evidence_pack.py`](../backend/app/evidence_pack.py) | Provenance-committed evidence pack (content hash). |
| 6 | [`backend/app/data_quality.py`](../backend/app/data_quality.py) | Public-safe Research-Ops / governance slice. |

## 2. How to run locally (offline, no secrets)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xjacobzhao-byte/pantheon-research-qwen-hackathon
cd pantheon-research-qwen-hackathon
docker compose up --build
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173   Backend: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Or without Docker:

```bash
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && uvicorn main:app --port 8000
# in another shell:
cd frontend && npm ci && npm run dev
```

## 3. How to run the judge smoke test

```bash
# with the backend running on :8000
./scripts/judge_smoke.sh
```

It exercises health, the evidence-pack hash, both overlays, the comparison
`data_state`, the data-quality panel, and the v2 Alibaba proof (host-honesty +
precise DB claim). It also best-effort pings the live Alibaba ECS box; if that
box is down, the offline checks still pass (`ALL GREEN`).

## 4. How to verify the live Alibaba proof

The same container image is deployed on a live Alibaba Cloud ECS box (Nginx →
Dockerized FastAPI). Verify Qwen is reachable *from Alibaba Cloud*:

```bash
curl -s http://8.222.191.152/api/proof/alibaba-cloud | jq
```

You should see `cloud_provider: "Alibaba Cloud"` and, on that host,
`alibaba_hosted: true`. A redacted capture of a **live** Qwen smoke call is
committed at
[`data/redacted_traces/alibaba_qwen_smoke_redacted.json`](../data/redacted_traces/alibaba_qwen_smoke_redacted.json).

See [`docs/live_proof.md`](live_proof.md) for full endpoint details.

## 5. How to inspect the Qwen integration code

- Base URL, model, auth: [`backend/app/qwen_overlay.py`](../backend/app/qwen_overlay.py) (`QWEN_BASE_URL`, `QWEN_MODEL`).
- OpenAI-compatible chat completion call via `httpx`, bounded retry/backoff.
- Fail-closed statuses in [`backend/app/models.py`](../backend/app/models.py) (`OverlayStatus`).
- Tests: [`backend/tests/test_qwen_fail_closed.py`](../backend/tests/test_qwen_fail_closed.py).

## 6. How to inspect the product UI

- Component: [`OverlayComparisonPanel.tsx`](../frontend/src/components/equity/OverlayComparisonPanel.tsx)
  (provider cards, agreement, divergences, evidence gaps, human-review gate,
  `data_state` badge, latency/model metadata, fail-closed states).
- Governance panel: [`DataQualityPanel.tsx`](../frontend/src/components/DataQualityPanel.tsx).
- Component tests (jsdom): [`OverlayComparisonPanel.test.tsx`](../frontend/src/components/equity/OverlayComparisonPanel.test.tsx).

## 7. What is included vs excluded

**Included (sanitized vertical slice):** dual-LLM overlay + comparison engine,
Alibaba proof v2, evidence pack with content hash, mini Research-Ops / data
quality, forward-validation methodology, redacted traces, product UI, tests, CI.

**Excluded (stays in the private production repo):** provider credentials, the
production database and its data, the full admin plane, broker/trading logic,
proprietary raw datasets, the multi-asset (crypto/macro/FICC) engines, and the
production research universe.

## 8. Safe claims and non-claims

**Safe claims**
- Qwen is called live via Alibaba Cloud DashScope when live mode is enabled.
- The same image runs on Railway and on an Alibaba ECS host; host is reported honestly.
- No secrets are committed or returned; the proof endpoint makes no external calls.
- Offline mode runs the full flow with bundled samples.
- LLMs never execute trades — every signal passes a human-review gate.

**Non-claims**
- No assertion that production data has been migrated into Alibaba RDS.
- No live DB connectivity is proven by the proof endpoint (`connected: null`).
- No alpha/performance claim — forward validation is required first
  (see [`docs/validation_methodology.md`](validation_methodology.md)).
- This repo is not the full production system.
